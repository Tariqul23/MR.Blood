			<table> <h2>Q: Why should I donate blood?</h2><br>

<h2>A: Safe blood saves lives and improves health.</h2> <br>Blood transfusion is needed for:
<ul>
 	<li>women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;</li>
 	<li>children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;</li>
 	<li>people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters; and</li>
 	<li>many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.</li>
</ul>
It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia <br>and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.<br>

There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood<br> can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy<br> people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.<br>

Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to<br> another person â€” the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if<br> your blood is separated into its components â€” red cells, platelets and plasma â€” which can be used individually<br> for patients with specific conditions.
